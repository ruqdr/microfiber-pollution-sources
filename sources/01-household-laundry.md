# Household Laundry

## Description

Household laundry is a major source of microfiber pollution, releasing synthetic microfibers from textiles during washing. Every wash cycle can shed thousands to millions of fibers, which then enter wastewater systems and eventually the environment.

## Primary Pathway to Environment

Microfibers are released during the washing process and are carried away with the wastewater. They pass through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) where a significant portion is captured, but a substantial number still escape into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some fibers also become airborne during drying or handling.

## Key Contributing Factors

- **Fabric type**: Synthetic fabrics like polyester, nylon, and acrylic shed more fibers than natural fibers.
- **Washing machine type**: Top-loading machines with agitators cause more abrasion and shedding compared to front-loading machines.
- **Detergent and additives**: Certain detergents and softeners can increase fiber release.
- **Water temperature**: Higher temperatures may increase fiber shedding.
- **Wash cycle duration and intensity**: Longer and more aggressive cycles lead to more fiber loss.
- **Garment age and wear**: Older, more worn garments shed more fibers.

## Key Research Findings

1. A study by Napper & Thompson (2016) found that a single wash of synthetic clothing can release over 700,000 microfibers. Polyester‑based fabrics shed the most fibers, especially fleece materials.
2. Research indicates that wastewater treatment plants can remove up to 95–99% of microfibers, but due to the enormous volume of laundry wastewater, even the remaining 1–5% represents a significant environmental load.
3. Microfibers from laundry have been detected in marine sediments, freshwater ecosystems, and even in drinking water, highlighting their pervasive distribution.
