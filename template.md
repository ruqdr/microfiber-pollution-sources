## Description

Brief description of the source of microfiber pollution.

## Primary Pathway to Environment

How microfibers from this source enter the environment (e.g., wastewater discharge, air deposition, direct release).

## Key Contributing Factors

List factors that influence the quantity or characteristics of microfiber release:
- Fabric type (e.g., polyester, nylon, acrylic)
- Mechanical stress (e.g., washing, abrasion)
- Environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pH)
- Process parameters (e.g., water flow, filtration)
